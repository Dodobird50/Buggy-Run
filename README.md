This is a simple JavaFX game via an Eclipse project that works similar to the traditional Snake game, but adds many challening features such as collecting points, a time limit, and dodging moving obstacles.
NOTE: this game requires JavaFX to operate. Take a look at https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Eclipse for instructions to set it up.
